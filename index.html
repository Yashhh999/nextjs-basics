        <h1>What is Next.js?</h1>
        <h2>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build
            user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.<br />

            It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on
            building your product and shipping quickly.<br />

            Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive,
            dynamic, and fast React applications.</h2>

    <section id="lesson2">
        <h1>App Router and Pages Router</h1>
        <h2>Next.js has two different routers:

            App Router: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
            Pages Router: The original router, still supported and being improved.

            At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router
            and the Pages Router docs.</h2>

    <h1>Now we will hop into actual installation</h1>

    <section id="lesson3">
        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <h2>Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:<br />
            Node.js 18.18 <br />
            or later. <br />
            macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.</h2>

        <h2>
            The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using create-next-app, which sets up everything
            automatically for you. To create a project, run:
            <span>
                npx create-next-app@latest
            </span>
            On installation, you'll see the following prompts:
            <span>
                What is your project named? my-app
                Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
                Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
                Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
                Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
                Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
                Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? No / Yes
                Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
                What import alias would you like configured? @/*
            </span>


            After the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and<br/> install the required dependencies.
